So the past few weeks the addon providers shut down and went away leaving some app unusable. I apolgize for the delay in updating, I wanted to be sure that the update was stable and the system as a whole was working correctly things were smooth. The massive retro tv section has been changed and honestly changed for the better if you see a retro program that isnt on the list please contact me @ dapackman611@gmail.com and I can add it to the list almost instanly upon receiving the request. Some episodes may require a second scan for it. If it doesnt come up theres a good chance that its not online.
